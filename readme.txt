You need to extend Types.java and SymbolTable.java in a meaningful
way, so that you can represent the semantic information and perform
all type checks.

A few very simple example programs are provided, but they do not not
cover all cases.  You must write further Simple programs so that you
can use all grammar nodes of the language semantically.

type_example_err.sim contains Simple code that must generate semantic
error messages, You should also extend this file with further tests
for errors.
